We are currently in the planning stages of SDL Tower Defense.  There are 2 members working on this project at the moment: CPress.Scott & CoreyRuda.

The goal of this game is to provide endless entertainment in a Tower Defense game.  We aim to accomplish this by being as innovative and complex as possible, while still remaining true to the nature of the original TD games (Vector TD, Flash Element TD, Bloons TD, etc).

While we welcome any suggestions (devs.sdltowerdefense@gmail.com), keep in mind that we are still in the planning process.  That means that we barely have any actual working parts; thusly, we aren't focusing on aspects of the game as much as we are focusing on developing the internal structure of the engines.
